ðŸŽ“ I have a **doctorate in composition and sound creation from UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al**. Since 2011 I have been developing in [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) a sound creation and spatialisation tool named **[Live 4 Life](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life)**, which aims to facilitate the **improvisation of electronic music on multiple speakers**. 

ðŸ”­ My **spatial research**, which questions ways of associating rhythmic and spatial parameters, is based on the concept of free and open works, both from the point of view of form and in the diffusion of open source code. **[Check this Wiki](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life/wiki)** for more personal thoughts and technical details on this life project.

ðŸ’» Currently **doing a postdoctoral internship at UQAM** in the School of Visual and Media Arts, from September 2022 until August 2024 under the supervision of [Philippe-Aubert Gauthier](https://github.com/pagauthier) thanks to FRQSC funding for post-doctoral research.

ðŸ‘¯ Currently **looking for audiovisual collaborations** both with **video developers** to create the visual from the sound data generated in open source, and with **dancers** (particularly traditional dances like Gigue from QuÃ©bec) to finally assess the impact between the gesture of the performer, the dancing bodies and the video environment. Technically, the audiovisual object mapping could be developed through open source tools, such as Processing, Open Frameworks, Hydra, or even through commercial tools like Touch Designer and Resolume, as long as the creation process and the code are published on Github and open to everyone.
