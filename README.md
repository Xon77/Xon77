I hold a doctorate in composition and sound creation from UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. I have been developing since 2011 a sound creation and spatialisation tool **[Live 4 Life](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life)**, which aims to facilitate the improvisation of electronic music on multiple speakers. 

My spatial research, which questions ways of associating rhythmic and spatial parameters, is based on the concept of free and open works, both from the point of view of form and in the diffusion of open source code (https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life).
